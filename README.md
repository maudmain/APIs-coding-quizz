## Instructions

User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers



Acceptance Criteria
Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:
- A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
- Questions contain buttons for each answer.
- When answer is clicked, the next question appears
- If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
- The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
- When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

## Usage
To view the final results, you will need to open the page in the browser [Deployed landing page]().

The landing page displays the quiz rules and a Start Quizz button.
